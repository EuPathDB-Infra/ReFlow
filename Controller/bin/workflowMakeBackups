This directory contains backups automatically created each time the workflow
runs.  The *_config.tar.gz files are a backup of workflow_home_dir/config.  The
*_graph.tar.gz files are a backup of the graph xml files in \$GUS_HOME/lib/xml/workflow.

These backups become very useful if you are attempting to upgrade the graph or
config and are getting errors that the graph has changed illegally.  In that
case, restore from these backups, UNDO the steps that are causing difficulty,
and unrestore.
