Restore of \$GUS_HOME/lib/xml/workflow and \$GUS_HOMElib/xml/datasources is done.

\$GUS_HOME/lib/xml/workflow was saved in \$GUS_HOME/lib/xml/workflow.sv.$time
\$GUS_HOME/lib/xml/datasources was saved in \$GUS_HOME/lib/xml/datasources.sv.$time

When you are done running your workflow using this restore, you have two options for
reverting to the prior state:

Option 1) generate and bld.   The only downside to this is that if you had a
          lib/xml/workflow/.html directory (for graph visualization) it will be lost.

Option 2) use the .sv.$time dirs to revert lib/xml/datasource and lib/xml/workflow.
          This is less convenient but will preserve the lib/xml/workflow/.html dir
          if you had one.

Once all is well, you might want to delete the .sv.$time dirs to save disk space.

Restore from a workflow backup.

Usage:  workflowRestoreBackup -h workflow_home_dir backup_dir_name

Where:
  backup_dir_name: the name of the backup dir in workflow_home_dir/backups to restore from

 Restores:
  - \$GUS_HOME/lib/xml/workflow
  - \$GUS_HOME/lib/xml/datasources

Makes a save of the directories it overwrites with suffix .sv.xxxxx where xxxxx
is the current time.

To choose the correct backup:
  - note that the controller makes a backup each time you start it up.
  - look in the controller log for the start time of controller run that had
    the version you want.
  - look for a backup with that time stamp.


To return to the latest code when done with the backup generate and bld (and optionally remove the .sv.xxxxx file).

(The backup directory also includes workflow_home/config, but this is not
restored automatically.  You can restore that manually if needed).
