Please see the [ReFlow Installation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bJr0jWktNhOf8XZtiAZDp8m0qi9Ny_pDmPMBH9vQ1mE/pub) for installation instructions.

ReFlow requires [DistribJob](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fpub%3Fid%3D1BixZ5t2c0hnOZES-Rk2wG2loAQqclcmRj7AeKQjZMHA) to control jobs on compute clusters. (DistribJob sits on top of queueing systems such as SGE and PBS.)
